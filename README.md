### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Hannes**

So, while learning JS frameworks, Python, and Django, I started diving deeper into PHP. And, wow... I didnâ€™t expect this, but Iâ€™m LOVING it. Like, itâ€™s just fun to work with.

I know itâ€™s not the trendiest language these days, but honestly? If youâ€™re learning to code, PHP is hands down one of the easiest and most rewarding places to start. So yeah, big PHP fan now. ðŸ¤˜
